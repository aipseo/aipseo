# AGENT Guide for AI Assistants

This document provides guidance for AI agents working with the **AIPSEO** repository.
It covers the project structure, setup, conventions, and common tasks to help you navigate
and contribute effectively.

## Repository Overview

> **AIPSEO** is a command-line interface for AI-powered SEO backlinks. It enables users to:

- Look up URL metrics (`lookup`)
- Check spam scores (`spam-score`)
- Manage wallets (`wallet create/balance/deposit/withdraw`)
- Interact with a backlink marketplace (`market list/buy/sell`)

```

## Setup & Development

The project targets **Python 3.8+** and uses [Hatchling](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for packaging.
Development and test settings (pytest, black, ruff) are configured in `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
# Install development dependencies (editable install)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Initialize default configuration
aipseo init
```

## Running & Testing

- **CLI help**: `aipseo --help` or `python -m aipseo.cli --help`
- **Run commands** as documented in `README.md`
- **Testing**: `pytest` (note: tests/ may need to be added)
- **Code style**:
  - Formatter: `black --line-length 88`
  - Linter: `ruff`

## Coding Conventions

When modifying the codebase, follow these conventions:

1. Preserve existing SPDX license headers (`# spdx-license-identifier: apache-2.0`)
2. Retain copyright notices at the top of source files.
3. Adhere to `black` and `ruff` style rules as configured in `pyproject.toml`.
4. Keep diffs focused and minimal; avoid unrelated changes.
5. Rely on clear code and docstrings; minimize inline comments.

## Common CLI Commands

Refer to `README.md` for full usage. Key commands include:

| Command                     | Description                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `aipseo init`               | Initialize aipseo.json configuration  |
| `aipseo validate`           | Validate configuration file           |
| `aipseo lookup <url>`       | Look up URL metadata                  |
| `aipseo spam-score <url>`   | Check spam score for a URL            |
| `aipseo wallet ...`         | Wallet management (create, balance, etc.) |
| `aipseo market ...`         | Marketplace operations (list, buy, sell) |

## AI Assistant Guidelines

1. Use this guide to orient and audit your changes.
2. Consult `README.md` and module docstrings for functional context.
3. Run local tests and style checks before proposing patches.
4. Avoid making assumptions; refer back to code, docs, and tests.
5. For API behavior or endpoints, inspect `aipseo/api.py` and `aipseo.json`.
